# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 14 January 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Declared to myself to commit to #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** Felt my love for coding again as I was trying a build my WordPress website using a template. Felt restricted but it made me want to learn and conquer the challenges!

### Day 1: 15 Jan 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC - HTML and CSS modules for a start as a refresher. 

**Thoughts**: disciplined and productive day. note to self: afternoon being the best time to work on practice. 


### Day 2: 16 Jan 2017

**Today's Progress**: refreshed my memory on Bootstrap and jQuery modules.

**Thoughts**: still disciplined. my muscle memory worked well for those frequently used shortcuts i did back then. tomorrow, i shall be working on my personal portfolio!

###Day 3: 23 Jan 2017

**Today's Progress**: Feels good to be back coding! Follow up on my Free Code Camp Portfolio task. 

**Thoughts**: I was away from coding for the past few days so it feels good to be back and get some work done. I realised I have forgotten about some CSS applications so working on my portfolio really helps to get on track. I also realised I prefer to work with HTML and CSS from (top to bottom) - to complete the page section by section will allow me to feel more satisfactory then if i were to code the whole page in HTML and then followed by CSS.
